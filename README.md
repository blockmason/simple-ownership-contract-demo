# Ownership DApp Demo

Blockmason is excited to launch our second blockchain product called [Link](https://mason.link). Link allows developers to use smart contracts and the power of blockchain in their web or mobile applications with very little to no prior blockchain experience. Link creates classic, conventional, web-based APIs for any smart contract written on a programmable blockchain (e.g. Ethereum). 

In this activity, we will use Link to record ownership of assets (in this example, collectible digital stamps) on the blockchain. 

With Link and its built-in private blockchain, there is no need to use common blockchain development tools such as Infura or acquire an underlying token such as ETH to pay for gas fees - it just works!

A simple front-end template is provided and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) will be used as the web application bundler and server.

The key steps of this activity are:
1. Setup project and install dependencies
2. Deploy a basic Ownership smart contract to the blockchain using Link
3. Configure a front-end JavaScript file
4. Run our decentralized application

### Setup

You will need to setup the following for this activity:

> Install `Node` and `npm`: https://nodejs.org/en/download/ (note - you can also use `yarn`)

> Clone the Github repo: https://github.com/blockmason/simple-ownership-contract-demo into a new folder.

>  In the new folder, run `npm install` to install the following dependencies:

* `@blockmason/link-sdk` - https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blockmason/link-sdk - a simple SDK for interacting with the Link project.

* `parcel-bundler` - https://parceljs.org/getting_started.html - for bundling and running the web application

> Create a Blockmason Link account - register at https://mason.link/sign-up and then setup your demo organization.
